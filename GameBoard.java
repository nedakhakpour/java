/**
 * Name: Neda Khakpour
 * Class: 2336.501
 * Running the program: With all the java files together in the same folder or workspace,
 * execute Project.java to run the program.
 *
 *
 * -Analysis-
 * This project implements a strategy board game played by two players, Black and
 * White. It is played on an N by N board. The winner is the player who has more
 * discs of his color than his opponent at the end of the game. This will happen when
 * neither of the two players has a legal move or there are no spaces left on the board.
 *
 * At the beginning of the game, two black discs and two white discs are placed in the
 * middle of the board. Black always begins, and the two players subsequently take turns moving.
 *
 * At each turn, a player must place a disc of his color on one of the empty squares of
 * the board, adjacent to an opponent's disc. No two matching colors are connected
 * vertically or horizontally so a miniature-chequered pattern is made.
 *
 * Both players take turns to make their move which consists of placing one piece
 * down in a legally acceptable position and then turning any of the opposing playerâ€™s
 * pieces where applicable. A legal move is one that consists of, for example, a black
 * piece being placed on the board that creates a straight line (vertical, horizontal
 * or diagonal which diagonal is optional for this project) made up of a black piece
 * at either end and only white pieces in between. When a player achieves this, they
 * must complete the move by turning any white pieces in between the two black so that
 * they line becomes entirely black. This turning action must be completed for every legal
 * turning line that is created with the placing of the new piece. Players will then continue
 * to move alternately until they get to the end of the game and a winner is decided. This decision
 * is reached by identifying which of the two opponents has the most pieces on the board.
 *
 * -Design-
 * In GameBoard.java, the board of the game is processed and re-processed inorder to find valid
 * coordinates, whether it be horizontally, diagonally, or vertically. The game board is also drawn up
 * and the disks are changed for each move made. This class is used more as a utility to the game itself,
 * processing all moves and drawing up what the user sees.
 *
 * The GameBoard class has a default constructor that takes the int value of the size of the board. Based
 * on that value, a char array of those sizes is created, and the center of the board is also calculated
 * and the disks are places in the center (in the appropriate order 'W' 'B', 'B' 'W'. The getLocations method
 * executes every possible valid move on the board, by going through each cell, empty, or filled, and verifying
 * possible or valid moves. If there is a valid location, the coordinate is added to the positions list.
 *
 * The finalResult method is used to determine the result, if found. The result checks to see who won the game,
 * or tied the game based on the game requirements. If non of the game requirements are met, the game continues until
 * it is. The updateScore method increments the scores based on the number of disks for each respective color
 * there are on the board. The move place method is used to changes the values of the disks once a move
 * has been made.
 *
 * All of these methods are used on a per-turn basis in the Game class, each being used to shape the game
 * and the board.
